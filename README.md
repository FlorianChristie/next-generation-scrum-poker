# next-generation-scrum-poker

Prototype for a new Scrum Poker

# Frontend

## Development

To test and develop the frontend, run

```shell
npm start
```

This will use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) to serve your app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Vite will automatically update the browser via hot module reloading on save while providing extremely fast rebuilds.

## Production Build

To generate a production build, run

```sh
npm run build:frontend
```

This will generate a folder `frontend/dist` that contains a directly deployable artifact without external dependencies that can be served as a static web site.

To test the production build locally, run

```shell
npm run preview
```
